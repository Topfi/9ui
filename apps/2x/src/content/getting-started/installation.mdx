<Step>Initialize</Step>

You can follow [shadcn installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to setup your project.

    		<AlertTitle>
    			Do not use plain `npx shadcn@latest init` command.
    				Use the command below instead.
    		</AlertTitle>
    	</Alert>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latest init https://9ui.dev/r/init.json
```

This command installs dependencies, 9ui theme and updates `globals.css` file.

<Step>Add `root` class to your app layout.</Step>

```tsx {2} title="layout.tsx"
<body>
	<div className="root">{children}</div>
</body>
```

<Step>That's it! You can now install the components.</Step>

</Steps>

# Icons

9ui uses [`lucide-react`](https://lucide.dev/) for icons.

For a more extensive collection of icons, consider using [`Monicon`](https://monicon-docs.vercel.app/), which offers over 200,000 icons from various popular libraries.

If you are looking for animated icons, the [`pqoqubbw/icons`](https://icons.pqoqubbw.dev/) library is a great choice.
